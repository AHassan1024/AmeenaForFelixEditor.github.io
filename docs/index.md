## Who is Ameena? <a name="aboutMe"></a>
I am a Joint Mathematics and Computer Science (JMC) undergraduate student at Imperial. I started my degree in 2018 (in the pre-Covid times) as an international student, took a gap year in 2019/20 and got involved in Felix as Puzzles Editor, became a British citizen, and am now looking forward to graduating in October. I have lived in (order of time spent): London, Singapore, Japan, Karachi, and Dubai.

## Why Ameena? <a name="competent"></a>
In December '21, I became Deputy Editor at Felix, and am Sam's right hand person. I have been involved with Felix for 3 years, and contribute mainly to the [News](https://felixonline.co.uk/issue/1792/news/strike-action-continues-for-ucu-members) and Puzzles sections. 

Beyond written contributions, I liaise weekly with Section Editors, Illustrators, Copy Editors, and committee members. I have 3 years' experience of using Adobe InDesign (software we use to lay out weekly Felix Issues) and have been present to witness the publishing process of over 20 issues of Felix this year. 

I have followed sensitive stories this year that required absolute conflidentiality, and have conducted interviews with people in which I have remained impartial. 

Opinion warning of why me: I think I'm pretty competent and well-informed about the realities of the role. I have a diverse set of experiences, having personally been both an international and home student, have experienced resits and the struggles that our student representatives face. I have seen the paper in its pre- and post-Covid states. Recovering from the pandemic will take time and effort, but I doubt it is impossible.

## Transparency Statement: <a name="transparency"></a>
As a candidate for Felix Editor (or Editor-in-Chief as we call it down in West Basement), I am placed in a position of trust - trust that I will take an unbiased position on contentious issues, and accurately relay the facts of the matter. To do this, I must be open and accountable to all students, and disclose any and all potential conflicts of interest.

However, I am actively involved in many things alongside my BEng in Joint Mathematics and Computer Science, so if you are aware of any omitted conflicts, please [email me](mailto:ameena.hassan18@imperial.ac.uk?subject=[Summer%20Elections%2027+22]%20You%20missed%20a%20conflict%20of%20interest%21) immediately.

## Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>
For reference, also available to read when voting:
Hi! I’m Ameena, and I’m running to be your next Felix Editor. I have been involved in Felix for three years; as puzzles editor, chief copyeditor, and deputy editor this year. I also contribute to the News section, which is a key responsibility of the Editor. I already have a good rapport with current and incoming section editors, and want to see the paper fully shake off the after effects of the pandemic.

My goals as Editor:
- extending distribution network
    - Conducting a distribution audit at non-South Kensington Campus and accommodation areas to accurately assess demand
- Regular weekly uploads of the paper
    - To the Felix website, every Thursday, before the paper is distributed
- Keeping the union and college accountable
    - Keeping to the Felix pledge of fair reporting without bias, and ensuring Comment contributions are better balanced
- Grow the Felix community
    - A big boost in social media use and regular workshops for contributors will restore the Felix society to its 2010s glory
